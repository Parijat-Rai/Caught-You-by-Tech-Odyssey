CAUGHT YOU!! will prevent people who are not wearing a mask to enter
public areas so that the extent to which the virus can spread can be
decreased. This will help all of us to feel much safer while we are buying
basic necessities.If some certain pre-decided conditions are met then a
certain instruction protocol will be initiated. We will use this in opening a
shop door automatically if someone is detected wearing a mask properly,
and if not then the doors won’t open….
Project Design : Project Design: Starting from the beginning we create
a Mask detection software using already uploaded images with and
without a mask on. When the condition of wearing a mask is met to a
satisfactory level, a certain instruction set will be initiated which will
control the opening and closing of automated doors.Project Design:
Starting from the beginning we create a Mask detection software using
already uploaded images with and without a mask on. When the
condition of wearing a mask is met to a satisfactory level, a certain
instruction set will be initiated which will control the opening and closing
of automated doors. When completed, “Caught you!!” will be able to
perform digital image processing using edge to edge mapping using
opencv and keras .
Hardware Specification:
A full stacked computer should be used with Numpy, Tensorflow
libraries installed in it , Raspberry pie 3 , Arduino uno , OmniVision
OV5647 , Sony IMX219.
Outcome Measures:
* Primary : Primary: When in its full setup Caught you !! will perform
digital image processing taken the face as input in use of computer
vision / graphics and AI edge to edge mapping would create datasets
which is custom made with using real mask images in it with Python
script with Keras, and TensorFlow as the backend.
* Secondary : This Will help in reducing the spread of covid and other
communicable diseases as the doors will be automated and will open if
the person wears a mask. Thus wearing a mask will become a
compulsion. It Will help to increase the trust of customers as they know
they will be in safe and conducive premises.
Drawbacks and the limitation:
1. People are still not open to their face data being processed and are
not eager to give their consent.
2. False detection of not wearing masks can cause problems. There’s
also the risk of errors due to flaws in the technology.
3. Loss of clear line of sight - our detection system might fail, in case if
something is obstructing someone’s face or the face isn’t visible from the
front view.
Conclusion:We all know Covid has changed everyone’s lifestyle and
people have adopted new ways to handle stuff around them. Mask being
the new normal! But few people still don’t follow rules which put them as
well as others around them in danger. And to this problem we The TechOdyssey came forward with a solution “CAUGHT YOU!!” an open-cv
software that is used to detect face masks
